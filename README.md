## About `requests`

The project includes the `requests` library for making HTTP requests to external APIs. and it's useful for:

- Fetching external data (quotes, random names, or public APIs)
- Downloading files or images
- Sending form data or interacting with third-party services

Example usage:
```python
import requests

resp = requests.get('https://api.quotable.io/random')
if resp.ok:
	quote = resp.json().get('content')
	author = resp.json().get('author')
	print(f'"{quote}" — {author}')
```

`requests` is already listed in `requirements.txt`.
