## Purpose DEVELOPMENT / DEPLOYMENT

The entire learning becomes fun when you working on real world applications and that's the point of this website to go live with lot setup rather than just doing some code... The process includes most powerful features like microsoft azure... etc

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flames-website.git
cd flames-website
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate # macOS / Linux
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
python -m flames_app.app
```

5. Open your browser at http://localhost:5000

## About `requests`

The project includes the `requests` library for making HTTP requests to external APIs. and it's useful for:

- Fetching external data (quotes, random names, or public APIs)
- Downloading files or images
- Sending form data or interacting with third-party services

Example usage:
```python
import requests

resp = requests.get('https://api.quotable.io/random')
if resp.ok:
	quote = resp.json().get('content')
	author = resp.json().get('author')
	print(f'"{quote}" — {author}')
```

`requests` is already listed in `requirements.txt`.
